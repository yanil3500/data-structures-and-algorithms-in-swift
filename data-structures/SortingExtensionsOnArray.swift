     Selection sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
     Selection sort runs in O(n^2), making it inefficient on a large collection of elements.
     Selection sort does have some performance advantages over more complicated sorts in certain situations, particularly
     where external memory is limited.
     The sort divides the input collection into two parts: the subcollection of items already sorted, built from left to
     right at the front of the collection, and, the subcollection of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of
     the list.
     Algorithms proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subcollection, exchanging it with the leftmost
     unsorted element (putting it in sorted order) and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
